# Billionaires
With this project we intend to create an application which will provide the user some information about their chances of becoming a billionaire based on some statistical data.

### Contributors 
The project is executed by Jan Hrušák and Viktória Nagy with the supervision of Martin Hronec.

### Data source
The data is acquired from the “Richest 250 People in the World” list. (https://www.therichest.com/top-lists/top-250-richest-people-in-the-world/)

### How it works
Depending on the question, input will be collected either by a free input bar or by picking objects from a list.
